# Unified Modeling Language ("Union of all Modeling Languages")
## Waterfall Model
- Requirements Engineering
  - Requests for change in requirements at any stage
- Design
- Implementation (To Design)
  - Lacking feedback loops for problems
- Testing/Verification (To Implementation)
- Maintenance (To Verification/Implementation)
  - Verifying patches
  - Forking updates to next version
## UML
- "Union of all Modeling Languages"
  - Enormous language
  - Many loosely related styles under one roof
- But
  - Provides a common, simple, graphical representation of software design and implementation
  - Allows developers, architects, and users to discuss the workings of the software
## Modeling Guidelines
- Nearly everything in UML is optional
- Models are rarely complete
- UML is "open to interpretation"
- UML is designed to be extended
## Static Modeling in UML
captures the fixed, code-level relationships in the system
- Class diagrams (widely used)
- Package diagrams
- Component diagrams
- Composite structure diagrams
- Deployment diagrams
## Behavioral Modeling with UML
captures the dynamic execution of a system
- Use case diagrams (widely used)
- Interaction diagrams
- Sequence diagrams (widely used)
- Collaboration diagrams
- State diagrams (widely used)
- Activity diagrams (widely used)
## Use Case Diagrams
capture the requirements of a system from teh user's perspective
- Inclusion
